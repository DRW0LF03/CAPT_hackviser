Penetration testing is the process of identifying potential security vulnerabilities in an organization's software, systems, and IT infrastructure by simulating real-world cyber attacks. These tests help organizations strengthen their defenses, identify critical vulnerabilities ahead of time, and minimize the impact of a potential security breach.

Penetration tests are conducted within the framework of a contract signed between the organization requesting the test and the organization performing the test. This contract ensures that the test activities are conducted legally and defines the scope of the test. Only the components specified in the contract may be tested, ensuring that the process adheres to both legal and ethical standards.

Professionals involved in penetration testing are usually referred to as "pentesters," "penetration testers," or "cybersecurity experts." These professionals conduct tests within the scope of their given authority using an ethical hacker approach and report the security vulnerabilities they identify.

### Types of Penetration Testing
Penetration tests can be classified into three main categories based on the level of information provided: White Box, Grey Box, and Black Box.

_**White Box**_

The team conducting the test is given comprehensive information and authority about the system. This approach allows for an in-depth analysis and testing of the system.

_**Grey Box**_

The team performing the test is provided with partial information and authority about the system. This creates a more realistic test scenario and demonstrates how pentesters can progress with partial information.

_**Black Box**_

The test team conducts the test without any prior knowledge about the system. This offers the most realistic scenario from the perspective of an actual attacker.

_**Penetration Testing Methodologies**_
Penetration testing methodologies are standardized approaches used to systematically identify and assess security vulnerabilities. These methodologies enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of penetration tests.

_**OWASP**_

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a global initiative focused on improving the security of web applications.

OSSTMM offers a detailed methodology that ensures security tests are conducted transparently, objectively, and repeatably. It also provides guidance for measuring security performance and continuously improving the security posture.

_**NIST**_

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) penetration testing methodology provides standards and best practices, particularly for government agencies and large-scale organizations. NIST's cybersecurity methodology encompasses risk management, the assessment of security vulnerabilities, and post-breach incident management processes. This methodology helps organizations conduct comprehensive security assessments and meet compliance requirements.

## Basic Information

#### Port
Ports are virtual or physical connection points used for data transfer between computers.

#### Physical Ports

Physical ports are hardware-based connection points found on computers. Examples include USB, Ethernet, HDMI, and DisplayPort, which are used to connect various devices to the computer and facilitate data transfer.

#### Virtual Ports

Virtual ports are numbered between 0 and 65535 and are used for communication over a network. Each port number is associated with specific services or protocols, and all data transfer over the internet occurs through these virtual ports.

For example, when visiting websites, we connect to port 80 or 443 on the server hosting the website.

Commonly used services and protocols operate on specific ports. Below is a table of some frequently used ports and services:

---


**Hardware Layer**: This is the physical foundation of the system, composed of the computer's processor (CPU), memory (RAM), storage (hard disks), and peripherals such as keyboards, mice, and printers.

**Kernel Layer**: The kernel is the heart of Linux and is vital to the operating system. It acts as an intermediary between software and hardware. The kernel manages tasks such as memory allocation, process scheduling (deciding when and what tasks the CPU should execute), and handling input/output requests from software. This layer ensures that different programs and users running on the system do not interfere with each other and have the necessary resources to operate.

**Shell Layer**: The shell is the user interface for accessing the services of the kernel. It is commonly a command-line interface (CLI) where users type commands, but graphical shells also exist. The shell allows users to interact with the kernel to run programs, manage files, and request other services by typing commands or using a graphical interface.

**System Utility Layer**: This layer contains various tools and applications necessary for performing tasks on the computer. System utilities can range from file management tools to software installers, network configuration tools, and more. They serve as a bridge between the user's commands (entered in the shell or through a graphical interface) and the kernel's handling of those commands.

>In summary, Linux architecture organizes the interaction between the computer's hardware and user activities from physical components to software applications through a well-defined management and control layer.
